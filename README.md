## 📌 What is Apache Hive?

Apache Hive is a **data warehouse system** built on top of Hadoop that enables querying large datasets stored in HDFS using **SQL-like syntax (HiveQL)**.

Hive abstracts complex distributed processing and allows users to perform analytics without writing low-level MapReduce code.
